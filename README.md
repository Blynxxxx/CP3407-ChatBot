# Project Proposal: Orientation Chatbot Application

## 1.	Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based chatbot application tailored to enhance the experience and engagement of new students during their orientation program. This chatbot will serve as an interactive digital assistant, providing immediate and accurate responses to questions about the orientation program and fostering connections among new students through suggested games and interactions. By leveraging data provided by the Student Affairs department, the chatbot will deliver an engaging, informative, and seamless experience for students, aligning with the department's goals of improved orientation outcomes and increased student satisfaction.

## 2.	Objectives

●	Develop a web-based chatbot capable of answering questions about the orientation program, based on information shared by the Student Affairs department.


●	Promote engagement and interaction among new students by suggesting games and collaborative activities.


●	Create a scalable and user-friendly platform that integrates seamlessly with the existing orientation process.


## 3.	Features

●	Information Support:


&emsp; o	Respond to frequently asked questions about the orientation schedule, locations, events, and other key details.


&emsp; o	Provide immediate clarification on orientation-related policies or procedures.


●	Interactive Suggestions:
