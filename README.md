# Project Proposal: Orientation Chatbot Application

## 1.	Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based chatbot application tailored to enhance the experience and engagement of new students during their orientation program. This chatbot will serve as an interactive digital assistant, providing immediate and accurate responses to questions about the orientation program and fostering connections among new students through suggested games and interactions. By leveraging data provided by the Student Affairs department, the chatbot will deliver an engaging, informative, and seamless experience for students, aligning with the department's goals of improved orientation outcomes and increased student satisfaction.

## 2.	Objectives

●	Develop a web-based chatbot capable of answering questions about the orientation program, based on information shared by the Student Affairs department.


●	Promote engagement and interaction among new students by suggesting games and collaborative activities.


●	Create a scalable and user-friendly platform that integrates seamlessly with the existing orientation process.


## 3.	Features

●	Information Support:


&emsp; o	Respond to frequently asked questions about the orientation schedule, locations, events, and other key details.


&emsp; o	Provide immediate clarification on orientation-related policies or procedures.


●	Interactive Suggestions:


&emsp; o	Recommend games or interactive activities to encourage socialization among students.


&emsp; o	Suggest team-building exercises or group discussions.


●	Feedback Collection:


&emsp; o	Collect feedback on the chatbot’s performance to enhance future iterations.


&emsp; o	Use feedback to improve the orientation program.

## Activity One
<b>Interview<b/><br>
1) What do you want?<br>
A chatbot that answers student's questions on Orientation<br>

2) What should the chatbot be like?<br>
It has to reply in a natural language.<br>

## Activity Two
<b>User Story </b><br>
Title : Obtain precise information<br>
Estimate: 13 days<br>
Description: A user will be able to obtain relevant information about orientation from the chatbot<br>

Title: Pick the question from the options<br>
Estimate: 3 days<br>
Description: Users want to see predefined options when they start interacting with the chatbot, so they can quickly get fixed answers to common questions without typing.<br>

Title: Ask question freely<br>
Estimate: 13 days<br>
Description: Users want to ask questions in their own words, so the chatbot can provide personalized responses based on its trained model.<br>

Title: Get useful suggestion<br>
Estimate: 13 days<br>
Description: A user will get useful suggestion from the chatbot regarding what to prepare for orientation (e.g. documents for student pass)<br>

Title: Feedback Collection<br>
Estimate: 8 days<br>
Description: Users can provide feedback about experience with the chatbot, so that the service can improve and better meet their needs.
